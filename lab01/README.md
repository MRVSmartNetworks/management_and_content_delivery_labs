# Laboratory 1

> The purpose of this lab is to simulate the operation of the output link of a router that is modeled as a queuing system and investigate its performance under variable configurations, to understand how different parameter settings may affect the system behaviour and how modifying some parameters of the network system may impact on performance metrics.
> In the considered queuing system, representing the output link of a router, the customers represent the packets that arrive to that output link, whereas the service represents the transmission on the channel. Finally, the waiting line represents the buffer where packets are stored before transmission.
